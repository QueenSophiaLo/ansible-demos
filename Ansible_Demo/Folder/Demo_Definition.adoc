## Using Ansible to Install a RHEL 8 VM Running RH Insights

The purpose of this demo is to familiarize the user with the deployment of applications with Ansible and show the user how they can run RH Insights on a virtualized RHEL 8 environment. At the end of this demo, the user should be more familiar with Ansible and how to deploy a virtual machine using an Ansible playbook


## The end result of running this demo

After running this demo, the user should have

* Installed Ansible

* Installed RH Virt-manager (a virtual mahcine environment running RHEL 8)

* RH Insights ready to use on the RHEL 8 VM

## Products/Technology used

### RHEL8

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is Red Hat's commercialized Linux distribution.

### Ansible

Ansible is an automation platform that automates cumbersome, repetitive or complex tasks. The purpose of this demo is to automate a RHEL 8 Virtual Machine installation using Ansible and then run RH Insights. 

### Kickstart

A kickstart file is a simple text file that contains configuration information for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation.

### Virt-Manager

Virt-manager is a desktop application that manages all of your virtual machines.

Using a virtual machine is ideal for testing out applications (such as Insights) as it gives the user an environment that is low risk. If the virtual machine crashes while the user is testing app functionality, another virtual machine can be made with no ill effects on the actual hardware system.

### link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/smart-management[Smart Management] (Insights)

Red Hat Smart Management allows the user to securely manage their RHEL environment using Red Hat Satellite and Red Hat Insights. Smart Management spans across environments, can manage at scale, and can protect your environment from security threats. We will be focusing on Red Hat Insights for this demo.

Insights is applicable for any system in your organization that needs frequent system checks and is included with a RHEL subscription. Insights helps to identify and remediate threats to security, performance, availability, and stability to avoid issues, outages, and unplanned downtime, and to ensure your Red Hat environment is operating optimally. 



## Requirements to run this demo

* An up to date version of RHEL 8 on a laptop or client system

* TO DO: list memory allocation size

* sudo access to your system

* Installation media (USB drive, CD)

## STEPS

1) First, make sure your system is up to date. You can ensure your system is up to date by running the following command in a command prompt

   $ sudo yum update
   
You'll know your system is completely updated when you see the messsage saying

   Complete!

2) Second, install Ansible. If you already have Ansible installed, you can skip this step. If you don't have Ansible installed, go to the Ansible Installation Guide linked here link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[(Install ansible)]

Or just run the following command into a command prompt

   $ sudo yum install ansible

3) Prepare an ISO File Using Kickstart

// Use Kickstart to automate RHEL installation...

// https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/performing_an_advanced_rhel_installation/creating-kickstart-files_installing-rhel-as-an-experienced-user

Download the ISO  link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download[here]


* Create a Kickstart file.

* Make the Kickstart file available on removable media, a hard drive or a network location.

* Create boot media, which will be used to begin the installation.

* Make the installation source available.

* Start the Kickstart installation.
