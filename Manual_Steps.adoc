1) First, make sure your system is up to date. You can ensure your system is up to date by running the following command in a command prompt

   $ sudo yum update
   
The terminal will display any packages needed to be installed or updated and prompt you to approve the downloads. Follow the on screen prompts.

You'll know your system is completely updated when you see the messsage saying

   Complete!
   
2) Second, install Ansible. If you already have Ansible installed, you can skip this step. If you don't have Ansible installed, go to the Ansible Installation Guide linked here link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[(Install ansible)]

Or just run the following command into a command prompt

   $ sudo yum install ansible  

3) Prepare an ISO file by downloading the ISO link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download[here]
